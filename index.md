# Rubaidh Ltd <small>Scottish for Ruby</small>

Yep, we are Scottish for Ruby. "Rubaidh" (pronounced *roo-bay*) is Scots Gaelic
for Ruby. It's a terribly clever name, or would be if it was it was easy to
spell. Rubaidh is the consulting company run by Graeme Mathieson, who's been
building things in Ruby for longer than most people in Scotland. Or the UK
for that matter.

But we're not just about Ruby, because building a business around a web service
involves more than just a Ruby on Rails web app.

# Design

Not drawing pretty pictures (though I can get some help with that, too). While
there's a lot to be said for not doing Big, up-front design with large
requirements specifications and months of slaving over a UML diagram, a little
bit of design goes a long way with an application architecture. It's worth
thinking about these things before diving in with a particular set of
technologies.

We've got depth of experience with a wide variety of web and mobile
technologies, and can advise on the right high level architecture for your
project.

# Develop

Ah, programming. The fun bit. :-)

# Deploy

Something pithy about puppets.

# Scale

And then you get to scale. When your business starts to take that traditional
hockey stick growth you've been dreaming of, you want to know that your app can
scale to the users who are beating down your door. (You'll be glad of a bit of
Design forethought right now.)

Scaling is fun, and there are strategies for dealing with it at every stage of
the architecture. We've scaled apps, learned the lessons and, most importantly,
made sure the business thrives.

Sounds good? I thought so, too. Drop Graeme an email to [mathie@rubaidh.com](mailto:mathie@rubaidh.com)
and let's see what we can build together.
